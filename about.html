    <h2>About Helionics</h2>

    <p><strong>Helionics</strong> is a federally incorporated non-profit under the <em>Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act (2025)</em>. Founded in 2025, Helionics is currently in its initial phase of strategic development, prototyping, and institutional engagement.</p>

    <p>We are committed to advancing foundational and applied science at the intersection of quantum materials, energy innovation, and computational modeling. Our work integrates machine learning with quantum mechanical simulations to identify <span class="highlight">quantum-driven phenomena</span> that surpass the limits of classical experimentation and current material synthesis techniques.</p>

    <p>Our current research efforts are focused on the development of AI-enhanced simulation frameworks and experimental strategies to explore condensed matter systems — particularly those involving the quantum manipulation of protons and electrons. These investigations target exotic material phases such as <span class="highlight">metallic hydrogen</span> and metastable hydrogen-based compounds.</p>

    <p>Helionics builds upon theoretical foundations from astrophysics, solid-state physics, and thermodynamics. The platforms we are developing aim to support breakthroughs in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean energy materials</li>
      <li>Advanced electronic and magnetic states</li>
      <li>Climate-relevant radiative emission modeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alignment with National Research Priorities</h3>
    <p>Our mission aligns directly with Canada’s strategic initiatives, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>National Quantum Strategy</strong>, fostering leadership in quantum sensing, communications, and simulation</li>
      <li>The <strong>Artificial Intelligence for Design Challenge Program</strong> (NRC), supporting AI-enabled scientific discovery</li>
      <li>The <strong>Critical Battery Materials Initiative</strong>, promoting next-generation materials and sustainable processing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through ongoing development of theoretical models, software infrastructure, and experimental validation, Helionics is preparing to transition into prototyping and applied deployment phases.</p>

    <p><strong>We invite collaboration</strong> from academic institutions, government agencies, and industry innovators interested in pioneering new frontiers in quantum science and materials design.</p>
