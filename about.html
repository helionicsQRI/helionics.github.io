    <h2>About Helionics</h2>

    <p><strong>Helionics</strong> is a federally incorporated non-profit under the <em>Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act (2025)</em>. Based in New Brunswick, Canada, we are in the early stages of institutional development, building our foundation through focused research design, prototyping, and strategic engagement.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to advance scientific discovery through high-fidelity simulation, quantum-informed modeling, and experimental investigation of advanced material systems. Helionics is rooted in the belief that scientific progress must be grounded in physically verifiable models, especially in domains that impact climate science, materials innovation, and energy systems.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      We integrate quantum mechanics, machine learning, and thermodynamics to explore material configurations and emission behaviors that challenge current assumptions and expand experimental frontiers.
    </div>

    <h3>Core Research Priorities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum Materials:</strong> Simulation and analysis of hydrogen-based and metastable phases, with attention to extreme states and phase transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrogen Innovation:</strong> Investigating behavior, emission properties, and potential use cases for hydrogen in clean energy systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Emission & Climate Modeling:</strong> Building radiation-based climate and thermodynamic models grounded in astrophysical and solid-state physics.</li>
      <li><strong>AI for Scientific Discovery:</strong> Using AI tools to accelerate hypothesis generation, pattern detection, and materials informatics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaboration & Growth</h3>
    <p>Helionics operates as a catalyst for scientific partnership, seeking alignment with national and international initiatives such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>National Quantum Strategy</strong></li>
      <li>The NRC’s <strong>AI for Design Challenge Program</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>Critical Battery Materials Initiative</strong></li>
      <li>Horizon Europe and other international science platforms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are currently seeking collaborators, funding partners, and research fellows interested in pioneering work at the intersection of quantum physics, condensed matter, and sustainable materials development.</p>
