    <h2>About Helionics</h2>
    <p><strong>Helionics</strong> is a federally incorporated Canadian non-profit research institute committed to advancing foundational and applied science at the intersection of quantum materials, energy innovation, and computational modeling.</p>

    <p>Our current focus is on developing <span class="highlight">AI-enhanced simulation frameworks</span> and experimental strategies to explore novel condensed matter systems—especially those involving quantum manipulation of protons and electrons in the pursuit of exotic material phases such as <span class="highlight">metallic hydrogen</span> and metastable hydrogen-based compounds.</p>

    <p>Our work builds on theoretical foundations drawn from astrophysical observations, solid-state physics, and advanced thermodynamics. By integrating machine learning with quantum mechanical modeling, we aim to identify material configurations and dynamic states that are inaccessible through classical experimentation alone.</p>

    <p>These platforms are being positioned to contribute to critical areas such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean energy materials</li>
      <li>Advanced electronic states</li>
      <li>Climate-relevant emission modeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alignment with Canadian Research Strategy</h3>
    <p>Helionics' mission aligns directly with Canada’s national research priorities, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>National Quantum Strategy</strong>, which promotes leadership in quantum sensing, communications, and simulation</li>
      <li>The <strong>Artificial Intelligence for Design Challenge Program</strong> under the NRC, supporting AI-enabled scientific discovery</li>
      <li>The <strong>Critical Battery Materials Initiative</strong>, fostering breakthroughs in next-generation energy materials and sustainable processing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through ongoing development of theoretical models and software infrastructure, and with an eye toward collaborative partnerships, Helionics is preparing to enter prototype development and applied validation phases.</p>

    <p>We are currently seeking institutional partners and public-private funding to accelerate this work and contribute to Canada’s innovation leadership in quantum science and sustainable materials technology.</p>
