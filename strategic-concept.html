    <h1>Strategic Concept: Quantum-Energy Innovation Facility</h1>
    <p>Positioning New Brunswick as a global hub for quantum-informed materials, emissivity science, and clean technology development.</p>
  </section>  <section class="fade-in callout">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Helionics proposes a multiphase facility in New Brunswick to validate quantum-informed climate models and pioneer hydrogen-based materials for clean energy technologies. Our dual mission: advance foundational science (emissivity, metallic hydrogen, solar structure) and develop high-performance applications (batteries, semiconductors). We seek alignment with federal programs and public-private partnerships to realize this vision.</p>
