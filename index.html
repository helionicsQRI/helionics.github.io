    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      Helionics is a federally incorporated Canadian non-profit research institute committed to advancing foundational and applied science at the intersection of quantum materials, energy innovation, and computational modeling. Our current focus is on developing AI-enhanced simulation frameworks and experimental strategies to explore novel condensed matter systems—especially those involving quantum manipulation of protons and electrons in the pursuit of exotic material phases such as metallic hydrogen and metastable hydrogen-based compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work builds on theoretical foundations drawn from astrophysical observations, solid-state physics, and advanced thermodynamics. By integrating machine learning with quantum mechanical modeling, we aim to identify material configurations and dynamic states that are inaccessible through classical experimentation alone. These platforms are being positioned to contribute to critical areas such as clean energy materials, advanced electronic states, and climate-relevant emission modeling.

    <p>
      Helionics' mission aligns directly with Canada’s national research priorities, particularly:
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>National Quantum Strategy</strong>, promoting leadership in quantum sensing, communications, and simulation.</li>
        <li>The <strong>AI for Design Challenge Program</strong> under NRC, supporting AI-enabled scientific discovery.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Critical Battery Materials Initiative</strong>, fostering breakthroughs in sustainable energy materials.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Through ongoing theoretical development and collaboration, Helionics is preparing to enter prototype and validation phases. We welcome institutional partnerships
