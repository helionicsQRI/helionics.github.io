    <h2>Programs & Strategic Direction</h2>

    <p>Helionics is developing a suite of applied research programs that operate at the intersection of quantum physics, computational modeling, and advanced materials science. While we are in the early stages of organizational development, our focus is already aligned with high-impact areas of national and international scientific priority.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      Our work is grounded in the belief that meaningful scientific progress begins with physically rigorous modeling, verified by experimental evidence, and advanced through responsible use of machine learning.
    </div>

    <h3>Our Focus Areas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum Materials Simulation:</strong> Developing AI-enhanced frameworks to explore novel hydrogen-based phases and quantum-driven states.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrogen Systems Innovation:</strong> Investigating advanced storage, emission, and dynamic behavior of hydrogen under extreme conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Scientific Emission Modeling:</strong> Applying first-principles radiative and thermal physics to climate and energy system analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Research Partnerships & Prototyping:</strong> Supporting early-stage prototyping and collaborative proposals across academia, government, and industry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Emerging Services</h3>
    <p>As our capabilities and partnerships grow, Helionics intends to offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contract research and simulation-as-a-service</li>
      <li>R&D support for clean energy materials and sensors</li>
      <li>Scientific advisory for emission and materials modeling</li>
      <li>Consortium building and grant collaboration facilitation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are particularly interested in working with Canadian and European partners aligned with emerging priorities in quantum science, climate adaptation, and sustainable materials innovation.</p>

    <p>If you're part of a research institution, startup, or funding body looking to explore high-fidelity science with measurable outcomes, we invite you to connect.</p>
